# NBA-CHAMPS

In this project, we aim to predict the NBA championship winner using various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. The data used for analysis consists of past performance metrics such as points per game, rebounds, assists and a few other stats. Our analysis revealed that certain metrics, such as offensive and defensive ratings, were the most important predictors of championship success. By applying Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting models, we were able to obtain high accuracy rates in our predictions. This study provides valuable insights for NBA teams and fans in understanding the factors contributing to winning a championship.

Loading the Dataset, Model fitting, evaluating the model, and deploying the model are the basic steps of predictive modelling that are being used on a dataset that contains various attributes of NBA stats. This predictive model uses ridge regression to determine which NBA team has a better chance to win the playoffs. This model gives us a predicted winning percentage of a team for every season from the year 2003.
